      <h1>Coping Strategies for Managing Stress and Anxiety</h1>
      <div className="coping-strategies-section">
        <h2>1. Exercise</h2>
        <p>
          Exercise is a great way to relieve stress and anxiety. It releases
          endorphins, which are natural mood boosters, and can help you feel
          more relaxed and calm.
        </p>
        <p>Some ways to incorporate exercise into your routine include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Going for a walk or run</li>
          <li>Joining a fitness class</li>
          <li>Doing yoga or pilates</li>
          <li>Playing a sport</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div className="coping-strategies-section">
        <h2>2. Practice Mindfulness</h2>
        <p>
          Mindfulness is the practice of being present and aware in the moment.
          It can help you focus on the present instead of worrying about the
          future or ruminating on the past, which can reduce stress and anxiety.
        </p>
        <p>Some ways to practice mindfulness include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Meditation</li>
          <li>Breathing exercises</li>
          <li>Yoga</li>
          <li>Progressive muscle relaxation</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div className="coping-strategies-section">
        <h2>3. Connect with Others</h2>
        <p>
          Connecting with others can help you feel supported and less alone,
          which can reduce stress and anxiety. You can connect with others in a
          variety of ways, such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Joining a support group</li>
          <li>Talking to a friend or family member</li>
          <li>Volunteering in your community</li>
          <li>Attending social events</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div className="coping-strategies-section">
        <h2>4. Get Enough Sleep</h2>
        <p>
          Sleep is crucial for both physical and mental health. Getting enough
          sleep can help you feel more rested and less stressed, while not
          getting enough sleep can increase feelings of anxiety.
        </p>
        <p>Some ways to improve your sleep include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Establishing a regular sleep schedule</li>
          <li>Creating a relaxing bedtime routine</li>
          <li>Avoiding screens before bed</li>
          <li>Avoiding caffeine and alcohol before bed</li>
        </ul>
